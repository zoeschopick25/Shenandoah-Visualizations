# Shenandoah-Visualizations

A project for Shenandoah University in Winchester, Virginia. The purpose was to analyze high school and college graduation rates of all states in the US in order to
highlight where Virginia is among them. In Virginia, we wanted to visualize the counties with high, medium, and low high school and college graduation rates.
